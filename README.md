248-Assignment4-PYTHON

Following the instructions of a Java Assignment I redid the assignment with Python in order to practice the basics of OOP in python and other basics.

The assignment mimicks a ticketbooth. We store opus (metro) cards as well as bus tickets. We remove and add opuscards and tickets, as well as edit them.

Please note: I cannot post the actual assignment, more information or the actual Java version of the assignment.
